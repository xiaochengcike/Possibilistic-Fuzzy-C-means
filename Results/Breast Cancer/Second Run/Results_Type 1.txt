Observations: (for Type 1 PFCM)
1) The change in the value of the user defined constants 'a' and 'eta' doesn't affect the error rate much.
2) The change in the value of the fuzzifier 'm' highly affects the error rate.
3) The increase in the value of b increases the training set error (slightly though) because it reduces the importance of the membership, and hence the typicality values have a
greater influence on the clustering results. The partition matrix (U) is the sole basis on which hard partitioning is done, and since the membership values are less accurate
it implies that hard-partitioning is also inaccurate.
